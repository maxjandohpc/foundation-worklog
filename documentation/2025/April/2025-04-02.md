## Prod Spec Batch Processing

Notes regarding prod spec about batch file processing: [Batch File Processing Spec](https://unz.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UPT/pages/1943371919/Core+P3+Batch+processing+outside+txn-core)

### [Requirement 01-2: Support batch processing for a defined set of transaction types and Payment Products](https://unz.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UPT/pages/1943371919/Core+P3+Batch+processing+outside+txn-core#Requirement-01-2%3A-Support-batch-processing-for-a-defined-set-of-transaction-types-and-Payment-Products)

There is mentioned that it is possible to add a sepa txn via the file. For this case we have to 
extend the data model in the csv file with the end-customers iban. 

1. Can we assume that we don't have to concern about specific data that is needed for a certain type
creation, e.g. SEPA?

```json
{
  "iban" : "DE66847224264393567945",
  "holder": "Asya Ghirmai"
}
```

### [US 05: As a merchant and as as internal agent I like to understand which transaction got created via “batch processing” and have access to a file archive](https://unz.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UPT/pages/1943371919/Core+P3+Batch+processing+outside+txn-core#US-05%3A-As-a-merchant-and-as-as-internal-agent-I-like-to-understand-which-transaction-got-created-via-%E2%80%9Cbatch-processing%E2%80%9D-and-have-access-to-a-file-archive)

#### [Requirement 05-1: Retention policy](https://unz.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UPT/pages/1943371919/Core+P3+Batch+processing+outside+txn-core#Requirement-05-1%3A-Retention-policy)

```text
File storage is to be done for 10 years, which corresponds to the legal retention period.
```
If we use a Amazon S3 bucket for this, we need to clarify how and if this is possible. Please do consider that such a 
huge amount of files will largely increase the cost of our cloud invoice for amazon.

#### [Requirement 05-3: Traceability of transaction origin](https://unz.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UPT/pages/1943371919/Core+P3+Batch+processing+outside+txn-core#Requirement-05-3%3A-Traceability-of-transaction-origin)

```text
(a) it was created via batch processing and 
(b) on the basis of which application and 
(c) on the basis of which file.
```
I think we can fulfill this via the metadata section block of the transaction:

```json5
{
  "metadata" : {
    "attributes": {
          "batchFile" : "sampleInputFile.csv"
       }
    },
    "dataschema" : "TransactionEvent:3.28-internal",
    "id" : "Tx-wy3sdjoyzbp",
    "origin" : "batch file processing",
    "routing" : "our new batch file service", // pls do consider that the routing block is a list of entries, so papi and pmp will add their stuff, too.
    "time": "Apr 2, 2025 @ 10:48:08.376",
    "traceId" : "a24db95d-8820-4152-bc73-6ccefdbb6b3e"
}	
```
Part a) can be resolved with the field "origin" and b) with the routing block. 
Maybe we add the file of section c) to the key-value map in attributes?

### [US 06: As a product manager I I want to be sure that monitoring is setup](https://unz.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UPT/pages/1943371919/Core+P3+Batch+processing+outside+txn-core#US-06%3A-As-a-product-manager-I-I-want-to-be-sure-that-monitoring-is-setup)

```text
Monitoring must expose:

which merchants are enabled to use the feature
```

Isn't that a thing to evaluate for insights? I mean there are the contracts and channels to activate a certain feature on unzer side?


```text
which errors occur (upload/ processing)
```
This can be done via Datadog in general either success/failure. 
The specific processing error reason is then mentioned in the output file.
Maybe we can add specific upload/processing errors as well to datadog, but this has to be evaluated and well thought 
if this is the right place.

```text
list of files uploaded and files processed including “upload user”
```
How do we know the user? Is it then provided by insights? We're getting only right now the keypair to execute the transaction via 
PAPI, we have no information which certain merchant nad more precisely which logged-in user from insights is linked to it.
If we have to provide from our a list which has uploaded which many files, then it has to be transmitted to the new service.


```text
1) The monitoring must also assure that no data loss took place when transferring the data from web application via new service 
and PAPI to processing system. 

2) If an error would occur on any point of the process lane, it must get exposed to the user 
of the web application (for now: Insights or MIA)- either as “upload error” or “processing error” or if the transaction 
got created but could not be executed as expected with a txn-result value that is not “success” and an error code and 
description from the processing system in charge. 
```
1) Risk can be reduced if we use a s3 bucket to save the uploaded files, instead of having it only in the ram. 
With a logical file on a disk we can repeat the processing in any error case
2) Processing errors:
   * The payment processing errors will appear in the response to our new service from PAPI, which we can then obviously 
   return in the output file.
   * Any errors regarding uploading or missing inside the csv which prevents further processing can also be written back
   to the output file


### [US 07: As a product manager I want to be sure KPIs can be measured](https://unz.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UPT/pages/1943371919/Core+P3+Batch+processing+outside+txn-core#US-07%3A-As-a-product-manager-I-want-to-be-sure-KPIs-can-be-measured)

```text
how many merchants use the feature in a period
how often internal users use the feature in a period
```
As already said, currently we're getting only the keypair, if we have to give such information as evaluation back, 
we have to receive it in the first place. 
**For me this information fits perfectly in insights, because they know which merchants are able
to use this feature as well as which internal users are using this**

```text
how many txn get created based on batch upload in a period
```

If we fill metadata for the lake as already mentioned in this document we could use opensearch "prod.p3.collected.transactions"
to filter on a certain time range the necessary information.

```text
which user uploaded which file in which application
```

How many applications do we have? I thought only Insights?

```text
proof that no “batch processing” is done from PaymentCore (old feature)
```
```

Can be found out in the scheduler logs were the old batch file processing application logs its data.

### [Requirement 01-5: Sensitive end customer data must get secured while file processing](https://unz.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UPT/pages/1943371919/Core+P3+Batch+processing+outside+txn-core#Requirement-01-5%3A-Sensitive-end-customer-data-must-get-secured-while-file-processing)

At the end of this topic, there is mentioned that a channel-id has to be provided in the output file. Please keep in kind
that there is no channel-id in the response of PAPI txn creation: (example here i s paypal):

```json5
{
  "id": "s-aut-1",
  "isSuccess": false,
  "isPending": true,
  "isResumed": false,
  "isError": false,
  "card3ds": false,
  "redirectUrl": "https://dev-payment.heidelpay.com/v1/redirect/paypalot/s-FvXB4Oc3tV8y",
  "message": {
    "code": "COR.000.200.000",
    "merchant": "Transaction pending",
    "customer": "Your payment is currently pending. Please contact us for more information."
  },
  "amount": "112.9400",
  "currency": "EUR",
  "returnUrl": "https://unzer.com",
  "date": "2025-04-02 07:49:41",
  "resources": {
    "paymentId": "s-pay-14451",
    "traceId": "ac52dee30bd76732da71b18c40b3a656",
    "typeId": "s-ppl-mofiaxn4m9i1"
  },
  "orderId": "payment-order-1743580175567-607",
  "paymentReference": "",
  "processing": {
    "uniqueId": "c2349e68.64a1.4069.a91c.931a28183291",
    "shortId": "1000.0037.3435",
    "traceId": "ac52dee30bd76732da71b18c40b3a656"
  }
}
```
neither during the type creation:

```json5
{
  "id": "s-ppl-mofiaxn4m9i1",
  "method": "paypal",
  "recurring": false,
  "geoLocation": {
    "clientIp": "185.228.241.157",
    "countryIsoA2": "DE"
  }
}
```
In the sample input file there is of course a channel mentioned, but is this also the case for p3 landscape?
PAPI is working with keypair, ins-->


## General Questions regarding data sending to PAPI.

To be able to send a txn to papi, we need a couple of things before we can do that.

1. There is a type required (e.g. paypal): https://dev-api.unzer.com/v1/types/paypal 
2. Do we need a customer object?, I suppose not: https://dev-api.unzer.com/v1/customers

Please keep in mind that the more data we need the more network requests we have to 
execute for each txn before.
